# Sara's Graphics Programming Project!
### A little dip into something more interesting and tickles my brain
I have been meaning to get into graphics programming for about a year or two now, since starting learning to progam in various languages.
Since coming across C++ - i can finally get into it in a performant manner! (Thank you Randall, on YouTube for your game dev series).

From this, i will learn to program basic software, and hopefully something more unique and official with friends or on my own. I dont have any exact ideas so far, but i am excited to get into it - especially for Virtual Reality.
